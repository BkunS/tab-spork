# tab-spork
A chrome extension that let you store current tabs aside and resume them anytime later when needed.

Two versions, one uses Vanilla JS and one uses React JS with webpack.

For React JS, just the "normal" way (haven't started yet).

For Vanilla JS, after seeing this: https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/708675139253174273
I believe it does have a point, so I intend to use only vanilla javascript with latest features supported by the browser without any other libraries or frameworks (not even JQuery or modulation). It's only a simple chrome extension, and I believe this is the way that fits its need best instead of being "scalable" or looking "elegant".

Note that this is just the early version that only implemented basic functions. The UI design will be improved and css stylesheet is also temporary for it being able to work and look normal.

How to use:
Now it's just Vanlilla JS. Download the whole folder of VanillaJS, go to Chrome extension page, make sure to check the developer mode on the top-right corner of the page and click on "load unpacked extension" button and locate the VanillaJS folder.
The extension icon should appear in your extension list which is an ugly icon drawn by myself :)
